# annepro2-qmk-docker

Docker image for compiling and flashing OpenAnnePro firmwares. 

## Motivation

Using a Docker image greatly simplifies the process of building and flashing custom firmwares since everything is included.
There is no need to clone all necessary repositories and install build dependencies on your machine.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Make

## Basic Usage

1. Clone this repository:

       git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mbenford/annepro2-qmk-docker

2. Build the docker image (this will take a few minutes to complete):

       cd annepro2-qmk-docker
       make image

2. Build and flash the firmwares (default keymap and Shine for model C18):

       make flash
	
You can also just run `make` to build the files only. They will be placed in `./build` so you can flash them manually.

## Advanced usage

### Using a different model

Use the `MODEL` variable to set what model you want to build/flash:

    make flash MODEL=c15

### Using a different keymap

You can build a different keymap by using the `KEYMAP` variable:

    make flash KEYMAP=default-full-caps

All keymaps in [the keymaps folder](https://github.com/OpenAnnePro/qmk_firmware/tree/keyboard-annepro2/keyboards/annepro2/keymaps)
can be used. You can also use your own keymaps as well by setting the `SRC_DIR` variable:

    make flash SRC_DIR=~/dotfiles/qmk/annepro KEYMAP=my-custom-keymap

`my-custom-keymap` must be a directory under `SRC_DIR/keymaps` containing your custom files - notably `keymap.c` and 
`config.h`.

### Using a custom Shine profile

You can provide your custom Shine files by using the `SRC_DIR` variable as well. All files must be located in 
`SRC_DIR/shine`.

### Building/flashing a specific module

You don't need to build and flash all modules (keymap and shine) all the time. Use the `MODULE` variable to specify
what you want to build:

    make flash MODULES=all    # all modules
    make flash MODULES=keymap # only keymap
    make flash MODULES=shine  # only shine
